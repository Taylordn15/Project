      <h1>Clan Symbol</h1>
      <p>Uchiha in another way of pronouncing "uchiha," a paper fan, which is incidentally the Uchiha clan symbol. Uchiwa can be used to fan flames, making the flame hotter — 
          referring to the fact that the Uchiha is a clan of fire-jutsu users. </p>

      <h2>Fire Release</h2>
      <p>Fire Release (火遁, Katon) is one of the basic elemental nature transformations. It is performed by moulding superheated chakra inside the stomach before releasing it via the lungs and mouth. There are also variants to this in the form of some mediums such as the use of gun powder,
           explosive tags and chakra flow into a weapon.</p>
